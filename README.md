# Kidney Failure Prediction for CKD Patients

This project develops predictive models to identify Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients at risk of progressing to kidney failure. The models employ machine learning techniques including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) using patient datasets from Australia and Japan.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- `data_preprocessing/`: Contains scripts and notebooks for preprocessing the AU and JP patient datasets to prepare them for model training and validation.

- `models/`: Includes the implementation of the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and RNN models, along with scripts for training, evaluation, and prediction.
